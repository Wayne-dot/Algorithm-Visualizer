    <h2>Introdcution</h2>

    <!-- Explination of the rule of the game, clue of the game -->
    <p id="intro">
        Nonograms, also called Hanjie, Paint by Numbers, Picross, Griddlers, and Pic-a-Pix, among other names, 
        are puzzles where you fill in or leave empty grid cells based on numbers at the edge to uncover a 
        hidden image that looks like pixel art. For more information,

        <div id="summary">
            <p>To summarize, you need to decide if the boxes needs to be 
                <span class="bold">fill</span> or 
                <span class="rounded border border-secondary">empty</span>.

    <h2>Purpose of this project</h2>

    <p id="purpose">
        I have coded an algorithm that will automatically solve this nonogram and visualize the algorithm with animation.
    </p>

    <h2>Idea behind the algorthim</h2>

    <p class="explain">Using basic logic, I am able to compute the probability of whether certain cells should be filled or left empty based on the number of edges. 
        <br> Here is an example, let's say we have a single row with five column of boxes:
    </p>

    <div id="demo">
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td id="demo_hint">
                    4
                </td>

                <td>
                </td>

                <td>
                </td>

                <td>
                </td>

                <td>
                </td>

                <td>
                </td>

            </tr>
        </table>
    </div>

    <p class="explain">The number at the left hand side is "4", meaning in this row, <span id="bold">fourt consecutive box</span> need to be fill. 
        In this crow, there are only two probability that can exist in this case.
    </p>

    <br> 
    <p class="explain">One is</p>

    <br>
    <p class="explain">Another one is</p>



    <!-- Some example of how it is play -->


    

    <!-- nest task -- customs parameter for column and row and black box initial condition-->

    <!-- next task -- explain how the algorthim work, show all combination, and choose the ones that are overlap-->
