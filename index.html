    <h1>Nonograms algorithm</h1>

    
    <h2 class=".bg-info">Rule of Nonograms</h2>
    <!-- Explination of the rule of the game, clue of the game -->

    <P>The goal of the nonogram is to determine whether or not if the color of each individual box should be white or black.
        There are hits that you can find that help you to solve the game given at the left end of the column and rows.
        For example, if the tops box indicate the number 3, that mean in this row/column there should be a 3 consecutive black box without any white box between them.
    </P>

    <p>
        In this project, I have code a algorithm that will solve this nongram project.

    <!-- nest task -- customs parameter for column and row and black box initial condition-->

    <!-- next task -- explain how the algorthim work, show all combination, and choose the ones that are overlap-->
